### Objective

To some, barbershops may seem like a thing of the distant past. Today, with the ubiqity of the hipster movement: edgy hairstyles, beards and whisky, a resurgence of barbershops has occured across the states.  By 2020, the industry is estimated to reach $26B and many barshops, salons or men's grooming centers are trying to find their space within this growing market. 

For our project, we decided to create a barber shop recommender system based on demographics and yelp reviews. The goal, is to help local business make actionable insights with data points relevant to their industry. 

Data will be collected through an online survey, yelp and google business api. 

Our data will be used to train a predictive model...

We'll display our predictions through a dynamic Shiny Dashboard.
