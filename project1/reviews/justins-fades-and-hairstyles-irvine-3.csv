6/29/2017,0.10625000000000001,Positive,"Totally unprofessional! Does not know the meaning of customer service and would never recommend. While I was getting a haircut he literally was telling me the most vulgar sexual experiences that I had no care in hearing about, never again!",0
11/26/2016,0.05285714285714286,Positive,"Honestly Justin, I thought you were super professional driving all the way back to the shop after forgetting about my 6pm appointment. You impressed me with your apologetic manner and constant assurance that you would be back at the shop in a jiffy. However, I was pretty offended throughout the haircut from one of your comments when I asked ""Who's dog is that?"", referring to the puppy that was sitting quietly on one of the wait chairs. You responded by asking me if I wanted to eat it, which was totally unprofessional and uncalled for seeing how I am Asian and the stereotype you were trying to convey. You said you were kidding, but I didn't find any humor in your sarcasm. Of course, I played it cool. You probably know who this is now that I brought that up. As for the haircut itself, the fade was decent, but the top of my hair was cut like a buzz cut, almost as if I'm enlisting into the military. The picture that I showed you on my phone before you started cutting my hair clearly showed that the front of my hair spikes upwards and longer than the rest of the back of my head. Almost like an upward trend on a graph. I'm only writing this review because the only comments I got on my haircut were questions and concerns over the quality of the haircut itself, not compliments. It sucks when you go into a family gathering and almost everyone asks what's wrong with your hair. I'll leave it at 2 stars because the service was fast. While I appreciate a barber who takes his or her time on their client, speed is important too. As for the price, $25 for a fade is steep, regardless of the hot towel and back massage incentive. And the complimentary beer too I guess. Overall, I probably won't be coming back even though I said I would. After showering, I realized how much I disliked my haircut and it really made me sad. Not gonna lie. Maybe I just had a bad experience or maybe you were rushed to go back home since I practically called you back into the shop. Either way, lesson learned.",0
