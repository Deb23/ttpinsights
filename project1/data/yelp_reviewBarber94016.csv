This a shout out to Nate and the Supreme Clientele Barber crew. First and foremost, this lounge has a very chill, clean, and an easy going atmosphere. All the barbers are friendly and would seem like they go out of their way for their clients!I've switched over to Nate a year ago and I haven't been disappointed. Being new to the city and the horror of trying to find a barber on short notice, Nate has lived up to the expectations. He's somehow remembered how I always want my cut since day 1 and the consistency has been A1. He's easy to get along with and I would definitely recommend him to anyone!"

I've been getting my hair cut by Victoria for over 2 years now. Even before she was in this shop! I've gone thru a couple of barbers and stayed with Victoria because I'm very particular about my hair cuts and she never forgets the little details that I'm picky about! This shop is brand new so everything is real nice and clean. They even have a fridge with waters and stuff which they tell you to help yourself to. I have a habit of showing up a little earlier than my appointment but she's always willing to take me. Lol  the owner Mike is also hella cool! But anyways, they take walk-ins. U won't be disappointed with either one of them! Thanks Victoria for always keeping me fresh!! :-)"

About a week ago Mike gave me a great cut last minute on a Friday. I saw the shop was new and he's open six days a week-- important for scheduling. Messaged Mike through yelp and he responded within a couple minutes with possible times for a cut. Got there, place was super clean and well lit with parking right in front.He had a couple questions on style but I gave him what instructions I could and he did his thing. Great instincts and communication in terms of what I needed.  My cut was a perfect balance between style and office-professional for my life. Takes credit card. Highly recommended. Great haircut and experience all around!"

Nate has been my barber since way back in high school, even before getting licensed and working at a few other high-end shops. Throughout the years, his talent and skill never cease to amaze me. Cleanest tapers and fades, sharp ass line ups, and all too even cuts up top when I need them.See I'm the type of guy to switch it up a lot. Sometimes I go for the slick-back look, or maybe an 8 up top with a taper on the sides, or my favorite high-top/low fade. No matter the style, Nate hits the nail on the head with each cut making me look literally 10x better and cleaner. Very professional and passionate about what he does. You will definitely NOT regret getting cut up by Nate. Hit his personal line @(650)240-6618."

Just moved to the Bay a few months ago, and I've been looking for my new go-to barber. Just found it! For its proximity to me, its price, and quality - Supreme Clientele cannot be beat. I had the pleasure of having Victoria cut my hair. It must've been fate, as I soon discovered she used to work at a store I currently work at.... what a small world! Victoria and the owner, Mike, were both there and very polite. Victoria was very down-to-earth and made sure I received the exact haircut I wanted. Right off the Colma BART station, this place is definitely very accessible and its surrounding environment gave it a friendly neighborhood feel. I WILL BE BACK!!!"

Long overdue. Came to this joint when it was somewhat new and was blown away with the level of care and precision they take to give you the perfect cut. My barber was Victoria and she was great! She made sure I knew what I wanted, spoke to me along the way and gave updates and was very easy to talk to. I'd highly recommend asking for her!"

Amazing work from Mike he was very professional and knowledgeable. Everyone was very friendly and respectful. Parking was available close to the shop which I loved, because you don't have to stress about getting a parking ticket. Appointments are highly recommended. But walk ins are more than welcomed. Debit cards are also accepted!"

Needed a last minute haircut on Wednesday and I came across this place. I called in to see if there were any vacant appointment spots that day and Mike told me to come in within the next hour and a half. Extremely prompt and straightforward and answered right away!It was my first time at this barbershop and I was definitely not disappointed. Mike can do some of the cleanest fades and cleans you up really well! I will definitely be coming back here because this guy really knows how to treat his customers well!5/5 for the amazing haircut!6/5 for awesome customer service!"

I experimented my first hair design in my life here seeking for a major change. Not knowing specifically what I want, I was amazed by Mike's marvelous instinct as a perfectionist barber and performed a beautiful fade hairstyle on me. It has made me so confident about myself like never before. The price was pretty fair and the environment was clean and equipped with AC. Definitely a solid five-star recommendation. Make an appointment and try it yourself! Mike真的是一位十分用心，追求完美的理髮師，設計的髮型也是無可挑剔，而且為人幽默風趣，熱情友好。強烈推薦！"

Been hopping around barbershops for the past 6 months. Haven't really settled with one due to my inconsistent nature of styling my hair and what cut I like. In short, I've never been 'wowed' when my cut is finished. Not the barber's fault. My expectations on what I want for a cut just doesn't mesh well when it's all finished.Today was a bit different. Came in for my appointment, waited a bit in their waiting area, and in no time, I was up. I knew what I wanted and Mike went to work. We chatted a bit and I want to say he's probably one of the more friendliest barbers I've met. I'm big on customer service and from my first time here, he gets a thumbs up from me.I wanted a bald fade pompadour hard part. It's exactly how I wanted it. He had that confidence while I was seated there and it showed in his work.Mike, you're great bro!I may have finally settled."

Professional, detail-smart, friendly, considerate, at a reasonable price, in a clean and safe environment, seriously only positive feedback to report on the experience.  There is even ample 30 minute parking located next to the shop.  On artistry, Mike puts his experience, training, and  knowledge of current styles and techniques to use when bringing his artistic creativity to my style.  He knows what you want as soon as you begin to describe what you are looking for. He knows, Black hair styles, Latino, and Asian.He keeps to his appointment schedule, and is flexible with changes with advanced notice. Cash only, and short hours on Monday.He deserves and earns your business. You deserve his attention to detail, and professional service. I already brought a friend who was more than satisfied with the results. Ill be back!"

Followed my boy Nate to this new spot. Moved from NYC about a year ago and it was tough to find a good barber out here so I pretty much go wherever he goes. Nate hooks you up, hit him up for a clean fade. The new shop is nice and clean too and got the old school hip hop to keep the atmosphere. Would definitely recommend!"

Mike replied back within the hour of yelp request for an appointment.  He was quick and thorough with my son haircut (shadow fade with trim on top). He even gel his hair, my son was very pleased with Mike. Our regular barber guy couldn't accommodate our schedule so that's how we found Mike on yelp.  It's a a little further distance for us since we are coming from the mid peninsula but we will most likely come back to Mike again for another cut in a few weeks.  Thanks Mike for the great clean cut!"

I've been getting my hair cut by Brian for over a year, and he has consistently given me a great cut every time.  He's given me the best fades, and he'll even pull out the straight razor for some clean lines.  He's very easy to make appointments with--just shoot him a text and he's quick to respond with his availability.     If you're curious about changing up your hairstyle, Brian is a great person to consult with since he was able to offer me a lot of suggestions.  Brian is also great if you value a consistent haircut, as he remembers my exact cut each time I sit in his chair.     If you're in the area and you're looking to relax while having a chill conversation and great cut, you should definitely check out this shop."

I've been getting cuts from Brian for a while now, and he's consistently given 5-star worthy cuts. When it's time for a haircut, I can easily text him to schedule an appointment, and he's typically very quick to respond. During the haircut, Brain's very attentive to delivering exactly what I want, and I appreciate his dedication to perfecting his craft. If you're looking for a buttery fade, great conversation, and an awesome barber experience overall, Brian's your guy!"

I've been growing a beard for 7 months and I've never grown a beard before so I didn't how to take care of it. Brian cleaned it up for me and made it look good. He even gave me tips on how to take care of it. Great place, I would definitely come here again."

A fairly new business with the potential to shine bright in the peninsula community. Needed to get a haircut asap and stumbled through this berbershop. Came in on short notice but the barber by the name of Brian was nice enough to take me in. I must say one of the best haircut experiences ever. He didnt rush, he took his time and it was cool to get to know him on a personal level and not to mention he cut my hair perfectly just the way I wanted it. He was very attentive and made sure he understood exactly the kind of haircut I wanted, and was then able to deliver exactly that. I am very happy with the results and will definitely come back. Not much of yelper but I feel that this deserved one. Highly recommend specifically Brian for your next cut. Thanks Again!!"

Called in for an appointment. Came in the next day and got a cut from Brian. We talked about the best cut for me to get and he even had examples on his phone of what kind of cut he was recommending. He talked me through what he was doing and how he was cutting. It took about 40 mins overall and my hair came out better than expected. Would highly recommend Brian because he is very enthusiastic and skilled."

I've been to Vik's a couple times now but he earned the 5 stars way back after my first visit.  The first time I came in, I'd been meaning to clean up my look for quite a while, but I'd never gotten my hair cut by a barber prior to that.  Needless to say, for a creature of habit such as myself, it was a nerve-wracking experience, not made any better by the fact that I find my hair very difficult to deal with.  I walked in with nothing but a couple reference pictures and a shrug, fully intending to leave it to fate, but Vik talked me through the whole thing and made sure to specify what I wanted and what he'd be doing.  The cut came out amazingly, and I'd genuinely never felt better about the way my hair looked prior to that.  Walked out a different person and I've been going back ever since.All in all, Vik's a great guy and a great barber.  Cute shop, super easy to talk to, and accommodating in every way.  Real talk: I don't know if it's a common thing but being able to text your barber for an appointment is incredible."

Answered first call late on a Sunday. Got me my desired appointment time the next day. I have extremely difficult hair for the cut I like: skin right taper w/ hard line; but Vik got it right the first time! Perfect cut. Great razor work. Reasonably priced. If i lived in the area this would be my barber.Thanks Vik!"

Viks takes his time with each haircut. He has plenty of tools to give you the perfect fade. Definitely knows what he's doing with each cut as shown by his vast array of tools and products. He does appointments only, but that's so he can take his time with each cut and not have another customer staring him down to hurry up. I've gone a few times already and was seated right away for my appointment. Fair prices for the great work done. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Vick is a great barber. He makes the process very easy to book appointments with him through text message. He also takes his time to cut your hair. You never feel like he's rushing or disconnected. Talking to him is very pleasant and enhances the whole experience.He is able to do great fades, over combs and other hairstyles. It's a very relaxing barbershop without a crowd of people waiting . You can just sit, relax and have your nice flawless haircut.

Been going to Viks a few times now and honestly have been searching for this type of barbershop my whole life. It's just him running the shop with his wife and we always have great conversations. Barber prices are very average ($25+) would definitely recommend to friends and family. Matter fact my uncle comes with his son here. 5 stars !!!"

Vik the Barber is great. Took my 10yr old in there to get a combover / fade. After making an appointment, which was EASY, arrived to the shop and watched him go to work. Professional, great conversation not just with me but my son as well, attention to detail and made sure we were happy with the cut. Also gave some tips on the different pomades to use and how to properly ""train"" my son's hair. Will definitely be coming back to Viks!"

Great spot for a haircut. Vik always leaves you with a precise and clean cut.

Took my 4 yr. old son to see Vik. Text him for an appointment. He's great! He listens to what you want, takes his time & is very detailed. If you've read the previous reviews they're 100% true & then some. When I inquired about the pomade he uses he told me he sold his last one yesterday. Vik was kind enough to give me the current jar he was using for free. Thank you again Vik! GO SEE HIM.

Viks is the best! I have been going to him a few times now and it is very easy to make an appointment with him. He is very knowledgable about what kind of haircut looks good on an individual and he really takes the time to do a great cut. I always come out with a haircut that exceeds my expectations. His shop is also very clean and he is great to converse with! Plus his prices are very reasonable for the Bay Area ($25+)."

Called this barber twice, first time no answer and no voicemail. Second attempt, no answer, went to voicemail and hung up. Voicemail said to text for faster service, so I did. Did not respond back to my text. Funny thing though, it showed me that he has read my text and still couldn't respond! Now, if you were the only barber in a 100-mile radius, I wouldn't even leave a comment. However, you literally have like 2 other barbershops within walking distance. I wanted to get a haircut here because all the 5-Stars, not saying you don't deserve it, but jeez when are these barbers going to develop business skills!"

I have been going here for just over a year now. Have found few shops and people that can not just cut my hair but my two sons. I look for convenience but quality and Fresh Cuts And Omar are that for me! He is able to get me in most the times I need and gives 3 of us quality cuts!"

I made an appointment with Omar.  When I arrived, he was finishing up a client.  When it was my turn, I showed him a picture of the haircut I want.  A conservative haircut, short on the sides but leaving enough length on the top to comb back.  Think Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, or Brad Pitt in Inglorious Basterds.  I'm a middle aged man and I like looking my age.I asked him, ""Can you do this?  Short on the sides, just a trim off the top"".  He shook his head and said,""yeah, yeah. Trim off the top"".I sat in the chair and started to talk about sports.  I realized that he wasn't talking back because he was texting on his phone while cutting my hair. I kid you not.  He even made a call while cutting my hair.Then I realized that I couldn't see the mirror from where I was seated.When he finally finished and showed me the mirror, he chopped off 5 inches off the top, leaving me with only less than 1 inch of hair.  The back of my head had something called ""a high taper fade"".  I never heard of such a thing and I definitely didn't ask for it.  I just wanted it short, instead I see skin nearly to the top of my skull.I paid and got out of there before I let my anger get the best of me.  I would have complained to the shop manager only I don't think there is one.  It wasn't until I got home and looked in the mirror that I realized that he nearly gave me the same haircut as the client before me.  This only leads me to believe that he can only do one type of haircut.So, I'm going to wear a hat for the next several weeks because I'm stuck with a haircut I hate until it grows out. Now I cannot speak of the other barbers, their reviews look solid.  But a lot has to be said about a shop who keeps this guy around judging from the other Yelp reviews (which I should have read before coming).Nothing is worse than a barber who doesn't listen to his clients."

Barber: OmarService: FHaircut: FOverall Grade: F       Customer service: Omar has zero phone etiquette. Grunting words like ""huh"" ""uh"" ""coo"" and ""yup"" he's not very welcoming in person either. Didn't acknowledge my presence. He looked right at me when I came in but didn't greet me or say anything. He was late on our set appointment by 15 minutes and when I finally made my way to the barber chair I seen his eyes were blood shot red and it all this made sense. While he was cutting my hair he was pre occupied with his phone. Kept taking breaks to check his phone and text without giving me any notice. Haircut: haircut was not up to par. I've had way better haircuts at other shops. He went way too high with my fade and the shear work is below average. He left the top uneven. I was unhappy with the final product. If I'm dropping $30 plus a tip I want my barber to be engaged, and trying to do a good job not high and smelling like weed, Omar seems to be disengaged with his profession. He is more focused on his phone. I work hard for my money and I feel like maybe he should too. Crazy to think this guy was at his job lol."

Pete is my go to here but all of the  barbers here give excellent cuts. As usual, it's an appointment culture here, very hard to get a walk in. Pete takes care of me almost all of the time. He's efficient and gives a quality cut. Besides giving a good cut he usually keeps a good conversation, which I believe is an underrated component of getting your haircut. If your going to sit in the chair for at least 30 min you should be having a good time while your there!"

Unless you have an appointment, don't bother coming in. These guys are booked throughout the week. The atmosphere is that of a brotherhood, everyone is super chill. I'd recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a detailed cut, by barbers that care about their profession. Still one of the only 2 shops I would go to in SF. 4 stars because of the of barbers flaked on me even though we made an appointment via text. Ended up getting cut by one of the other barbers."

Neli is an amazing barber! He really takes care of you, is fair, and incredibly honest. I hit him up because my coworker had this amazing, clean fade that Neli did and I was like, ""Hey man, who does your hair? Hook me up."" You will not believe how many people have complimented me on my hair these past two days, it is ridiculous. I've also been called brave which is hilarious. That aside, Neli scheduled me at the end of all his other appointments because he knew going from normal female hair length to shorter than some men's hair was going to be a challenge. Straight off the bat I could tell I was dealing with someone who not only understood customer service, but actually gave a shit about me. He told me about all the research and advice he acquired to make sure I would be happy with my cut. He took his time and my hair looks sick. I don't recommend him to any woman who wants to take the plunge into near baldness (because this was a very long process and cutting female hairstyles is not his forte), but if your hair is already boyish short or you just want to add an undercut/fade definitely go to Neli. He really cares about his craft and about his customers. Honesty and kindness are the only traits I look for when I pay for a service and he treated me with utmost respect from the moment we connected to the moment I stepped out the door. PS: When I told him the haircut that I wanted, he referred me to a friend of his who might be able to get my hair done perfectly. WHO DOES THAT? I've had so many people compete for business that they will chop my hair into a mess before letting someone else do it. But when she declined due to logistical barriers, he agreed to cut my hair and did an amazing job. PRO TIP: So many people tried to walk-in during my haircut. Always make an appointment, these guys are busy. Plan a week in advance so they can fit you in.

Neil is the barber that I always go to see over at Fresh Cuts. I met Neli last year when he worked at the Fine Line. I was changing my look from shaggy to trim for my brothers wedding and Neli hit me with one of his righteous tapers that he is known for. My girl always compliments me when I have a new cut from Neli and then I get tons of head rubs! He touches up all the lines with a straight blade so it looks sharp a$$. I really like how professional Neli and the other barbers are over at Fresh Cuts. And the dudes have tons of trophies from Barber competitions to boot. The owner had just won the fastest taper at a big competition.the shop is really clean. The music is always bumping so I would recommend you check them out if your looking for a fresh cut!Also be sure to call and make an appointment for your cut. These barbers are busy most of the day because they have tons of repeat customers."

I'm a creature of habit and the idea of switching deodorant gives me anxiety. Switching barber's is a very difficult decision to make. but it was necessary on this day. I found Josh on what naysayers would call accident. Called the shop and asked for the next barber with time on Saturday. Josh was that man. The shop is very clean and that's worth a star in and of itself.Josh and I had a few conversations about what I wanted and much like the rest of our life, communication is the key to success. He started the fade, stopped once he had one side done to ask some questions and get feedback so we were on the same page. Class act this kid.I was highly impressed with Josh and his work. Very organized, communicates well and end result was a 5 star cut."

I have been going to the location for over an year now. It's a very friendly and family oriented location. Pete has been cutting my son and I. His hair cuts are always on point and he works with my son really well. Gotta give him credit my son squirms like a worm on a hook. Pete has always been very helpful with scheduling. I work construction so the hours are crazy. Pete seems to be able to fit me in always. Even though I can switch appointments multiple times in a week. Highly recommend this spot. If your looking for a reliable and friendly barber, from my personal experience no knock on the other fellas, Pete is your guy"

Updated review



I came in with such high hopes due to the popularity of this shop in the area. I ended up scheduling with Omar and this guy had horrible customer service. He would literally take 3-4 minute breaks to text on his phone and I was just sitting there, looking back occasionally in hopes that he would start again. On top of that, the cut itself look nothing like the picture I showed him. Unfortunately, I was on the only seat where there was no mirror in front of me so I had no idea what it looked like until the very end. I trusted him, but I was very disappointed on how my hair turned out. He also said he only takes cash. So I had to go to the bank and get cash back only to come back to him saying he also doesn't have change. Lastly, he held onto my license when I went to the bank and forgot to exchange it back when I paid him. On top of that, I asked him the next day why he didn't send me a text that he had it. He stated that he didn't have my number, but he only took appointments so he had my number along with my reservation. When I pointed that out, he said he had so many appointments that he didn't know which was mine. This is a very frustrating because he obviously had my ID and could have match it to his appointments. Absolutely terrible. Avoid at all costs."

This place gets five stars because of...1. Neli, who takes his time making sure he gives you the cleanest fade. I followed him when he moved over from Fine Line because he cuts just the way you want it. And he's always talking about his training and barber conventions and stuff, so you know he takes it seriously and wants to make your hair perfect.2. The shop itself. It's big and spacious. It's clean. They got a big tv playing ESPN. Every piece of furniture looks new and kept up and they are comfortable to sit on and lounge if you have to wait a little bit. 3. It's right next to In-N-Out and Krispy Kreme so when you're done getting your fresh cut, you can go chow down on some really good burgers and donuts."

Been getting cut by Sherm for years. Parking is a breeze and every time you go in its like hanging with the boys. All the barbers in here are really friendly. If you're in need of a solid cut schedule an appointment here!"

Had to get a straight razor shave the day before my wedding and a beard trim. Jason hooked it up. I was honestly surprised that I was able to get a same day appointment on a Saturday due to someone canceling their appointment.Jason was very detailed and thorough. During the straight razor shave, I didn't get one cut and I felt great afterwards. All throughout my wedding I kept getting complimented on my beard so this trip was well worth it.I don't go to barbers very often but I might just have to spoil myself more often now. Thanks again for the great experience :)"

I'm generally pretty weary about just anyone cut my hair. I have mixed hair which can become an obstacle for some barbers.Jay gave me one of the best designed and most balanced haircuts I've ever had. He worked quick and efficiently.  I get my haircut once a week, and generally one of the biggest issues for me is the line up, but Jay's got me crisp and even."

I took my 1 year old son to The Cutlery for his very first haircut. John was so good with my son! He made sure to always check in with us about how we wanted my son's hair. He walked us through everything he was doing, which is great for parents experiencing the first-haircut stage! He let my son sit on my lap, which helped in keeping him still. Anytime my son would move or look at what was going on, John was quick to joke/play with him which made him more comfortable.Thanks, John!! Such a good experience. I highly recommend this shop."

I've been getting my hair cut at the same place for 20 years. Even after I moved to Daly City, I continued to drive 30 miles to Palo Alto to have my hair cut. I used to get it colored and cut, but then decided to embrace the gray and just go for a very short haircut. I learned, the hard way, that you either need really short hair or really long hair when you live on the coast. The humidity and wind will wreak havoc on anything in between. I started getting a mini flat top haircut, but decided that a 60 mile round trip probably wasn't necessary. It's not environmentally responsible. Surely, there are some decent barbers in the Daly City area. My first instinct was to go to Great Clips. After researching them on Yelp, I decided against it. Perusing nearby barbers, I found The Cutlery and its numerous 5 star reviews. I decided to give it a go.I called them at 11am and asked for an appointment the next day. I booked a haircut with Jose with ease. He confirmed my appointment over SMS the next day. I now have his cell phone number, so I can book future appointments via text messages.Make sure to make an appointment. If you read the reviews, the people with complaints showed up as walk ins and the barbers were too busy to accommodate them. The Cutlery is busy because they offer great hair cuts at a fair price. When I showed up for my appointment, it looked busy, but Jose said that it was actually a slow day!The actual hair cut is one of the best I have had in my life. My previous stylist was very good and had at least 30 years of experience. Jose is recent graduate of cosmetology school, and you wouldn't know it. He was precise and took great care to ensure that I had the perfect cut. He spent 30 minutes working on my mini flat top, and it was perfect. I actually let my hair grow for 4 months, and it looked horrible from the back. It took a little more effort to cut my hair and get it lined up and faded just right. He didn't rush the haircut at all, but instead strove for perfection.I also have to mention the vibe in this place. It's an urban barber shop, and not a salon. They have pictures of Tupac and Dr. Dre on the wall and hip hop music on the stereo. I really like the vibe. There's nothing pretentious about it, yet the barbers are consummate professionals.After my experience at The Cutlery, I've decided to become a regular customer. Jose gave me a perfect haircut at a reasonable price. They're within walking distance of my condo. I've lived here for 15 years and had no idea this place even existed. I just learned that I can get a perfect haircut for a great price just a few blocks from home.








Jose at The Cutlery gave me the perfect haircut. Photo taken shortly after waking up, so there's a little ""bed head"", but it is still tight!

This was the first time I got my haircut here and I am already a loyal customer. I called in to make an appointment and got scheduled the next day with Darlene. She was super friendly and very helpful in making sure she knew what kind of cut I wanted to get. She showed me different pictures of different cuts to give me visuals and suggestions on what she thought I might like. When she was done, I got the exact cut that I had wanting to get for months. She did what other barbers at other locations couldn't do. This looks to be the consistent high level of skill and service that all of the barbers at the Cutlery Barber Shop have to offer. I will definitely be going back. Thanks again Darlene!!"

I've been getting my haircut for almost a year at a bougie-ass salon near my school in Oakland that basically severs my limbs every time I hand them my credit card, where they don't specialize in fades as most of its patrons have hair longer than the style I sport. Decided to bite the bullet and go to a barber shop to get cut, instead! Best. Decision. Ever. I called the shop and a nice-sounding girl booked me to come in that day. This girl's name is Darlene and BOY BUDDY THIS CHICK KNOWS HOW TO CLIP! I have what is arguably the thickest, coarsest, most texturized Asian hair that could probably use a weed whacker most days. No problem for Darlene! Not only did we instantly hit it off chatting about makeup and hair, she suggested a bald fade and did a nice drop on it that was smooth af and looked slick as all hell honestly. The people of San Francisco take it upon themselves to verbally acknowledge just how fly my fade is (on the bus, bart, in the store, walking on the street, etc.) And the notion of going to a barber shop was very intimidating but as a woman I don't hesitate to brag about my barber being a *very talented* woman as well! GURRRL (and guys) trust me when I say Darlene is the ONE. Because I've come back for her and will continue to. Time and time again."

Been a loyal customer to this barbershop since they've opened and describe this shop as a professional, clean, and well capitalized business. I personally go to Kevin also known as Shorty (last chair to the left, near the restroom) and is a barber that cares for his craft and an expert in cutting hair. I personally get a taper and the hair cut is unmatched. He pays attention to detail in all aspects of my haircut from my line up, beard, and proper measurements for my taper. And is willing to go back if something is not up to your liking. The rest of the barbers in the shop are cool, outgoing, and very professional with their clients. From kids haircuts, comb overs, fades, designs, and classic hairs cuts, I've seen it all in this shop!! TIP: Make your appointments in advance to prevent any issues and to ensure a fresh cut when coming to the shop! Don't walk in expecting a cut without an appointment. 5 Stars for The Cutlery !!!"

Worst fucking customer service ever. These folks are more concerned with leaving work prior to closing than servicing customers. The other reviews on this place seemed positive, so I decided to give this place a shot after work. Left work early to come out here, and sat down as a walk-in customer at 615pm. There were 4 guys still working and they looked about finished with all of their clients. Then one guy asks me, 'do you have an appointment?' No. I don't, but I came with the understanding that they take walk in customers. He said they did, but they couldn't take me, because they close soon (in 45 mins). He asked what kind of a cut I wanted, I explained, and it's a simple cut usually taking only 15 mins to do.  Instead, all 4 of them were concerned with going home early than admitting a new customer. I told them my situation - going out of town tomorrow and really hoped to have this done today - but, nope. These guys give no shits. While walking out, one of the guys handed me a business card. Please. I am never coming back here, don't even kid yourselves."

Moved to the San Bruno area and was looking for a new barber. Ran across the good reviews here and stopped by. Was a bit worried as most of the customer images were showing guys with close cropped fades. I shouldn't have been. Had Kevin and the man is an expert. I showed him a pic (41.media.tumblr.com/b461…) and he cut my hair to look almost the same. He did a great fade (mixing scissors and clippers) and textured the top of my hair nicely. Really impressive work and he has a new customer going forward.One additional note--it's cash only"

I have been going to this barbershop exclusively for about 2 years now. I was skeptical at first but after the treatment I received the first time and ever subsequent time I have never been happier. Please make an appointment as they rarely have time for walkins. There is one review here from last year that grills them for denying a customer at 6:15pm and that his cut would only take 15 minutes; well for this place even the simplest of cuts they have taken their time and done the job right, making sure all the lines were straight. You go here for an experience not just an in and out in like 10 minutes sort of thing."

It took me four months after moving to the bay to find a good barber. This place has premium quality barbers. My first time going in I had Kevin who was awesome. He spent the time to explain things about my hair I didn't even know my whole life. He gave me the best cut and fade I'd ever had. He's a true master of his craft. The quality of service here is outstanding and the place is spotless and clean."

I'm so happy I found this place when I moved back to the Bay. I was afraid I wouldn't find a good barber for my hair. Luckily my friend recommended me this place and the rest is history.I get my cut by shorty and he always does a fine job. He knew exactly how to cut my hair and what I wanted. Good service and takes his time too. I highly recommend this place and also you should call in advance to book an appointment. $20 usually a cut sometimes $25, but hey, it's worth it!"

I had lost faith in finding a good consistent barber until I was introduced to Tubz. A couple of my good friends had been getting cut by him and after seeing their clean haircuts, I had to try him. I was able to set up an appointment with him about a year ago and I have been going back to him on a weekly basis ever since!The Shop: Tubz started cutting at Tailormade Barbershop a couple months ago.The shop has a very chill vibe. All the barbers seem very friendly and professional. They have four big flat screen TVs, so regardless of where you sit in the shop, you will have some entertainment. Plenty of seating and clean. They do accept walk-ins, but all the barbers are pretty good, so therefore they are booked most the time. I would recommend setting up an appointment. Parking: The majority of parking is 1-hour meter. However, if you turn the corner there are some all day spots and I rarely have trouble finding one.Tubz: This man is an artist and can do it all. Tapers, Fades, Designs, Combovers, Lineups, etc. You name it, he can do it. His attention to detail is is insane! The one thing I love about Tubz is he makes sure his clients get the haircut they are looking for exactly to your liking. I usually get a 1.5 on top, with a bald taper and get my beard cleaned up. I am very picky with my beard, but every time Tubz got me walking out the shop feeling myself! His beard game is . Every now and then I'll have him give me the old school Nas part design and it never disappoints. Tubz is a chill cool dude. My kind of people. I highly recommend Tubz! Trust me






























Tubz always got me feeling myself when I walk out the shop lol BaldTaper #BeardGame

I set an appointment and they were really really flexible with the fact that I had school. My assigned barber, I believe it was Chad, was a bit behind on schedule and they were still able to get another one for me, in a very short amount of time! Tubbs was willing to get off his break to give me a cut. Which by the way, for what I requested, it took WAY less time than I thought. I didn't really know what I was doing seen as I don't go out to cut much and so I didn't really know what I wanted: but he got me a sharp hard part, an even fade, and a sick line up. All under 25 minutes and for $35! Definitely recommend. They're friendly, have a comfy couch and an aesthetic shop :)"

This is a spacious and professional barbershop where I've never walked out disappointed. I've been getting cut by the barber Tubbs for quite some time now.Tubbs is super responsive with setting up appointments, which is helpful when trying to plan out the rest of your week. Tubbs will help you figure out a hairstyle you'll be happy with, and not take the easy way out. He's suggested haircuts for me that are more time consuming than my usual buzz cut, which showed me that he's not trying to rush me out out of the shop. All in all, I truly feel respected as a customer/client here and I would recommend anyone to check this spot out. Easily, 5 stars."

My son now will go nowhere else but here to have his haircut. Hes been here three times in the past year to different barbers and just recently had chad cut his hair and we never have been disapointed.

These guy know what they're doing. Nuff said. Honestly a solid shop and solid experience every cut I get. Everyone is welcoming and Mark, who has been my barber for about the past 8 months or so, always knows how to work you in his schedule somehow. Can't say enough about the quality of the cut. These guys are a serious bargain in these parts. I mean you can go into downtown sf and get the same exact cut and they'll charge you $80.I usually get a 1-2 bald fade so I can space out about 2 weeks, and as simple as that sounds, since my hair is a little thinner most barbers don't fade it out correctly. I've been to about 8-9 different barber shops all around the bay (D and R's, Heff's, People's, Nate's, San Mateo Zoo to name a few) and this is the spot that has continually given quality and accuracy on every different cut I've asked for. You the man Mark! Keep grindin! See you in 2 weeks!"

The conversations, the laughs, the music. You'll never get that at Supercuts ‍ just saying.."

This is the cleanest barbershops I've ever seen in the mission area, actually in any barbershop my better half has tried or I've walked into. The vibe of the place is soo chill and relaxed. It's also a bunch of guys together, so it being clean is quite surprising to me, no offense.There's a quaint little sitting area and they place music while they work, so it's not one of those awkwardly quiet situations of silence and waiting for girlfriends and those waiting for their cut. I also find it really cute how the guys interact with one another and all sing verses of the songs together. You can really feel their respect for one another, and the genuine friendship they all have.Vic is a great barber -as I'm quite sure the other barbers to a superb job as well. I am super picky with my boyfriend's hair, as I'm the one who sees it the most -with that being said, I have yet to be disappointed with the work Vic's been doing.As the saying goes, ""birds of the same feather, flock together."" As I'm sitting here writing this review, I can't help but observe Jamie and the way he's interacting with his current customer (this little boy). I really admire how he's taking the time to talk to the young boy about his school and etc. Rarely have I seen a barber actually interact with a child and hold conversations without talking down to the kid. So, shoutout to you!The price is average but the cuts are great. I would suggest making an appointment tho, as the guys here really take pride in their work and won't let you step out until you're satisfied."

After wasting time & money at another barber shop off Valencia. I called B&G and spoke with a guy named Mike and locked in an appointment.Although I was just driving through SF on my way back to Tx. I had to get cleaned up to get back to work.Sat in Mikes chair and felt like I was home. Mark was super chill and the spot was laid back.

The barbers here really make you feel at home and the setup there is super dope. Victor Salvador, one of the barbers at this shop is my go to guy. He always takes his time and pays attention to all the details when cutting my hair. I've known this guy since he was cutting hair for fun in his basement 10 years ago and not only has his barber skills develop drastically over the years but who he is as a person has as well. Every time I'm sitting in his chair we always share some laughter and have meaningful conversations about life. Not only do I look good but feel good after a cut from him. In the before picture of me below was what I was rockin' before I let Victor touch my hair. As you can see in the after picture yo boy can finally go out in public without people laughing at me. 5 stars to a great barbershop with one of my favorite barbers to ever to do it."

No matter what you need in the way of the proper barber for your needs they got a chair that will flip your wig! Plus the shop has that barber shop talk, jokes, fun and plenty of parking. Make sure to call... They stay busy, make sure to call.

My first legit barber experience today with Mark and I was super happy with it! Since I got my side shave I've been wanting to go get something designed but all the nearby shops had sketch reviews. This spot is the perfect balance of chill, hipster, homeboys, and Jagged Edge. Also appreciated that Mark took his time (I didn't know what was possible so he freestyled), you can tell he cares about his art and knows what he's doing. He also was way more gentle then even some salon stylists I been too. So you're welcome ladies (and gents), I just found you your new man!"

This place should be called ""Feel like Cuts"" because obviously they didn't feel like cutting my hair. Scheduled an appointment and barber never showed up. Waited over an hour!!"
117,"2/10/2015
    

Mark is the man! Before I started getting my hair cut from him I used to have my brothers cut my hair. But from now on no one cuts my hair but my professional barber Mark! He's a beast! It's always good talkin shop with this guy. Funny down to earth man. Even if I lived 100 miles away I would still walk, drive, fly, sail, bike, swim, scooter my ass to get a cut from him.  But enough about Mark. All the barbers at black n gold are legit! All cool guys! From kids to male and female whoever they'll get the job done! But you better call a few days in advanced they're so good they get booked quick and you don't want a supercutz cut because you lagged on making an appointment. From fades to combovers to sick designs black and gold got you! Make those appointments!"

I thought this place was gonna be great, especially after reading all the reviews and seeing 5 stars after 5 stars. But Samer really knows how to disappoint. I will never ever come back here again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH SAMER/SAM. He is the worst barber ever."

Coming from LA, this is definitely the best barbershop I've found in the Bay. Make sure you call and set up an appointment and pay for a quality cut. I've been getting cut by Jamie the last couple months and haven't had one complaint."
120,"2/22/2018
    

Looked up a few barber shops on yelp and this one seemed to have the most consistent reviews, so I came in and was not disappointed.  Ken was my barber and was very knowledgeable, and even gave suggestions based on my hair and style.  Prices are competitive with a standard commercial shop, but the experience was more in line with a specialty shop.  I would recommend giving this place a try; great cut, good value, and good conversation.   to Ken for representing this establishment at a 5 Star level."

I work for a group home of teenage boys and I've been searching for the best barbershop in the area for me to take them to. Since we found this place, this is the only place they seem to like coming to. They willingly take walk-ins which is a big thing for my group of boys as they are always on the go with sports and meetings. The man in the first chair, Ken, is always welcoming and respectful. Their customer service is A+ and makes my boys and I want to continue coming back. ""He's really chill"" -as one of the boys describe him. My boys are at the age where their appearance matters. It makes me feel good seeing how much more confident  (and handsome) my youth are after getting their haircut by Ken at R&R barbershop. And yes, he can cut ""black"" hair!! (Inside joke)"

There is a great set a guys in here. I came in without an appointment was able to still get some great service. Ken was my barber and he did great work. He listened to what I asked, and gave some advice. I don't usually do reviews but anything I can do to help these guys stay local."

So happy for Derrick and Austin on opening there own shop. Personally I have gotten cut by both, and both do an amazing job on their craft. Other than their skill to make you look ""fly"" for any occasion, both of their personalities blend together to set up a comfortable atmosphere in the shop. I have been getting cut by Derrick for the past 3 years now and have not been disappoint. I highly recommend R&B BARBERSHOP!"

Place sucks. I call the guy, he tells me they are busy I begged told him I'll pay him twice the price so he says come through. I sit on the chair, the guys gets a call on speaker scheduling people for later that day. I'm like wth this guys was acting like he was packed on the phone now he's taking down appointments for the day? Then I explain to him that I coil my hair from right to left and my sides I like faded. He literally fades my sides with 2 most obvious drops and doesn't even touch the top of my head. I explained to him that my hair was un even and if he could trim one side a bit more he acted like it was the first time he ever heard that. Then after 5 minutes of explaining his partner finally explained to him and he half assed it for 1/2 a minute then handed me the motor. Also through his phone call he asks me beard on or off, I said off. Too busy talking so he didn't even touch it. I figured the guy just wanted to send me on my way. My hair will grow back.. but my one star review will stay :) FYI his price is $25 I handed him $60 told him Merry Christmas and left. Never again."

Great establishment ran by individuals with good moral values. Both barbers are attentive to details and really execute your requested hairstyle flawlessly. I've been coming to get my haircut by both of these barbers (Austin & Derrick) for awhile and I did not contemplate going anywhere else once they opened their own barbershop 15 miles  away from my house. They say you should always have one good barber, I am fortunate to have two. Another cool aspect about this shop is, every Wednesday they only take walk ins so there is no need to schedule an appointment. I definitely recommend this shop for anyone looking for a new barber."

I've been getting cut but Derrick for years. I followed him from San mateo to his new shop. I would not let anyone touch my head besides him. Austin would be my back up for sure, he also has bars but Derrick is my guy. Definitely a friendly environment, they alway shave debates about sports or stuff that going on with our lives. Just make sure you get a appointment and your straight"

Jordan is fantastic. I showed him a picture of the look I was going for & he did it with perfection! I've just moved to the Bay area & have been here for a little over a month. Jordan is my barber from now on. Perfect fade & looks sharp."

I recently moved to Millbrae after living in the East Bay my entire life and I thought finding a barber here would be a nightmare. Luckily I stumbled upon Fine Line while on Yelp and decided to give them a shot. I haven't looked back since, Jordan has been a true blessing. I have extremely sensitive skin around my neck/beard area which could get a bit difficult for barbers to cut through without causing irritation. Jordan takes his time with his craft and has great attention to detail which leaves me looking so fresh and so clean every time. Appreciate you Jordan!"

No frills locale barbershop, worth the trip from my area in San Mateo. Got probably one of my best fades since moving here from NY for a decent price compared to other cuts I've gotten.

This is a really cool spot. Really hard to find a barbershop that's affordable and does a great job. Far removed from all the yuppies in DT SF, which makes it even better. No $40.00 haircut here with a PBJ, just a straight up real barbershop that offers clean cuts. Jordan does a great job. Idk the other barber's name, but I've seen him do great work as well. Also open 7 days a week!! Hit this place up. Appointments only."

Stylish, fresh, and affordable haircuts are rarer than apartments in the city with free parking.  Whats even rarer is a Barber/Artist who is as meticulous as Pete.Pete is a master of his craft and alongside your haircut will provide you with hilarious stories, sporting updates, and even Netflix recommendations.Sometimes you have to spoil yourself...an outstanding haircut is a great way to start."

I work in the woods and havent had a chance to post this review but I just wanted to say, this place is run and owned by some good and genuine people. This is a shout out to my barber Nelly. My first interaction with Nelly was actually on the phone. Even though he was booked with appointments and couldn't cut my hair he went out of the way to connect me with his old barber college in Daily City. He made sure I was in good hands and I had a fantastic cut from the barber college. Fast forward several months later, I had the privilege of seeing Nelly in person. He's professional, down to earth and I have so much respect for his art. The way he trims, his dedication and how he integrates his style was apparent in my cut. Now, my hair isn't easy. I got some thick Asian hair with two hair whorls but Nelly managed to do an excellent job event though we went over time. He's a great person to get to know, very approachable, and appreciated how much dedication he put into my hair. Cutting hair is not easy and Nelly did such a fantastic job with my crazy ass hair and couldn't have asked for anything more. Thank you so much Nelly, looking forward to seeing you again. Keep doing you and your art. Peace"

My barber is Pete. Great guy, does great work really takes his time to make sure you are getting the cut you want. He will even give his recommendations based on how your hair is, give you advice or show you how to overcome some kind of hair issue. He is also an entertaining guy with personality and character. I feel like the barbershop would be dull without him. Pete still keeps it professional, always answers back when I text him about appointments. When you go to fine line ask for him first."

Took me a while to find a good barber shop in the hood.  I finally found one.  There are others but Fineline is bar none.  Friendly and professional service.  Been coming here for a while now.  All the folks at FineLine are super legit.  Pete usually hooks me up with a nice fade and taper.  Austin and A.D. are there also and cut you up with the freshness.  These cats are always busy.  Better call and make an appointment.  Without one you'll be waiting a while.  The conversation, music and cuts here are always good, can't go wrong."

I was in need of a last minute cut. Came in asked if they do walk ins and he said no but his earliest available appointment was at 4:00 and it was 12:00 so I said oh yeah I'd come back. He took my name and number and shook my hand. I was like wow very professional!Came back and he was ready. The seats are really comfortable! I was able to find out so much about the barber in only 50mins because that's how long it took. His name was Pete. Really friendly and great with clippers.I was expecting the cost to be like $25-30 but he said only $20 so it was reasonable.I would defiantly come back to Pete and the shop only because he really made me feel welcomed and comfortable."

I heard good things about this barbershop so I decided to walk in on Monday afternoon. There was one Barber working on a fade that took 45 minutes. After it was done I got in the chair and he asked if I had an appointment and proceeded to tell me 'tough luck' because I wasn't 'alan' and that I needed an appointment. I politely said nobody told me when I walked in and was waiting for almost an hour that I needed an appointment. They didn't even apologize or offer to cut my hair. Worst experience at a barbershop in the Bay Area by far. Do not go here."
162,"11/19/2017
    

I came here with a specific haircut in mind and showed the barber exactly what I wanted (It was a picture of me from a previous haircut) he said he could do it. Halfway through the haircut, I realise he has completely shaved off my side burns and given me a taper at the back, none of which I asked for. The final haircut was nothing like the picture and I am very unhappy with it. I would not recommend this place if you have something specific in mind because they just gave me whatever they felt like."

I came here about two weeks ago. I told the guy very clearly, I DO NOT WANT TO COMB MY HAIR. After an hour of listening about weed and lifting, the guy hands me a mirror and says you're going to have to comb your hair. Then he tells me the cost is 25 USD. I left with no tip. When I got out one of their neighbors was blocking my car. I left looking like Robin from the Batman Animated Series from the 90's with a horrible line up. Come here if you want potheads that don't know how to take instructions to cut your hair. I wish I could give negative stars. P.S. They play tacky hip hop."

If I can give 0 stars I would. Everyone here that's given them 5 stars are all friends of theirs. You can tell by how they wrote their review. I called early in the day to make an appointment. More like the morning. The guy ""San"" or ""sam"" w.e... made an appointment for 5pm. I get there at 450pm. I wait about until 520pm just cuz all the barbers were cutting hair still when I got in. So when the time comes for me to ask... why is it taking so long. I had an appointment at 5pm. And ""San"" tells me to come back in a couple of hours. WTF. and I asked why and he tells me two other guys are in front of me. And I was waiting there longer than all the other people that came in after. Super unprofessional.  Don't accept and make an appointment if your going to tell them to come back in a couple of hours. Overall. Ima stick with the cutlery. They are professional and they do get upset if the clients are late. Vs city fades that tells you to come back in a couple of hours from your appointment. And all they talked about was Weed and I heard one of em asking for CHP. Yep. This is probably one of the first few of many 1 stars to come to this business. The guy gave me his card also as I left. I threw the weak ass card away right when I stepped out of the barbershop."

Best barbershop in the San Francisco and Daly City hands down! Great atmosphere, wifi hotspot, and it's connected to a shoe store!! I went in with my boyfriend, barbershops usually make me uncomfortable because I'm a girl but the vibe in this shop is super chill. My boyfriend got a low taper fade from Henry and he looked sexy!  I even got to use their free wifi, so I didn't have to waste my data. I stream a lot.

The first time I came here, I got an awful haircut because the lady was impatient so I decided I wouldn't come here again. The second time, other places were closed on a Saturday or too expensive, so I came back here as a last result because I needed a hair cut pretty badly.Michelle cut my hair this time and she did a fine job. She listened to my requests and got rid of my cowlicks when I asked her to fix them. I'll return in the future as long as Michelle is available."

Here $10 gets you a good haircut, but only by the shop's veteran barber Michelle. Michelle is the one customers look for, which makes her the queen of Generation Cuts. Michelle conjures up sincere conversation and can cut a great haircut at the same time.Michelle has been here for years. She knows the vendors up and down the block. There aren't many reviews here because most of her clientele are older folks and their children/grandchildren. Which makes me wonder if that's why they called it Generation Cuts. I'll ask next time.4 stars because Michelle is tough to have do your hair. Parking is a bit tough too. Parking spots on Mission and in the back is seldom found. Which is why I park at the Walgreens behind the Western Union."
