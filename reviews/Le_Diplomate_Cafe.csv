A must try and I promise you won't regret it. The bread of the sandwich is so gooooooood!",6/2/2018,GFal58tIzEOxcbUzYQunFA,"Santa Ana, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,1,Angela B.
1,"The service is great here, as are the prices.Especially their happy hour deal for sandwich, chips and a drink, very much worth it if you are on a budget.Not a huge fan of their sandwiches, but i would return for their coffee.Both the Vietnamese and the sea foam were good, not the best ever, but surely worth getting when in the area.Food and drinks are made to order quickly, perfect if you don;t have much time.Rounding up for great service and fair prices.",6/17/2018,kw4IR5ElxJV9hPEalk196w,"Los Angeles, CA",5.0,4.0,yelp,12,Nijole T.
2,"Three words: GARLIC CHICKEN SANDWICH. Oh my goodness...such a simple sandwich but take one bite and your mind will be blown, guaranteed! I don't know what they put in that garlic sauce but it is freaking addicting!!! I can honestly probably eat here everyday. Add some sriracha if you like a little bit of a kick in your food and bam! perfection in your mouth :)Love this place & miss it every day. Bonus points: Its right across the street from UCI campus making it super convenient for students to pop in for a quick bite in between classes. Another favorite thing about this place for me back when I was in school!",5/30/2018,6Zkvr2rjyfzCz8CbHpsRvA,"Irvine, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,2,Catherine N.
3,"I feel bad leaving a mediocre review. The service was great and all but the food/drinks were not the best. My co worker swore up and down this place had a delicious garlic chicken sandwich. So I guess I had already started out with high hopes for this place. Which isn't always a good thing. I should've asked what was inside the sandwich. I was picturing chopped grilled chicken with greens and some garlic aioli and just a light sandwich overall. Totally the contrary. This was just a simple sandwich. No greens. Only chopped chicken, cheese, and over abundant amount of aioli sauce. I had to squeeze that sauce out because it felt like grease in my mouth with the first bite I took. There was just way too much. The baguette was well toasted and I probably would've just preferred that alone. We also ordered their Vietnamese coffee. Totally mild even with easy ice! I would never get it again. Didn't do much for me with the light flavor.",3/27/2018,jk6qlYfaw77wVxZvsHPcSg,"Garden Grove, CA",5.0,3.0,yelp,28,Brenda P.
4,"Chicken, garlic, mushroom and broccoli, and chicken, garlic, eggplant and tomato sandwiches from my fav sandwich place across the street from UCIrvine, CA. If you're ever in the area, you gotta try these sandwiches; fresh ingredients, basically delivery vehicles for their AMAZING garlic mayo! I also got a side of their awesome ranch sauce and extra garlic sauce. SO good. Great/über friendly service (02/06/18 | 8:40pm-ish)....",2/23/2018,KdwFOQq_pnKVq4yfGTw0rg,"Midvale, UT",5.0,5.0,yelp,6,Joshua S.
5,"Le Diplomate Cafe is the perfect grab-n-go sandwich place. Located in UTC (the University Town Center), if you want a warm sandwich, this is the place to go! I love that they also sell Bahn Mi. I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my sister, and we both loved it. Food ordered:1. Chicken Broccoli Mushroom with garlic sauce (5/5): If you want a hot sandwich, this is amazing. I'm sure the garlic sauce on any sandwich is amazing, but I particularly loved how the melted cheese covered the broccoli and mushroom. As for the meat, the chicken is tender and perfectly cooked. With all ingredients placed in a fresh, warm, and crispy baguette, this sandwich was heavenly.2. BBQ Bahn Mi (5/5): This classic Vietnamese baguette sandwich comes with BBQ pork, pickled veggies, cilantro, and an optional jalepeno. I love bahn mi, so this sandwich was great. Although slightly pricier than most traditional Vietnamese establishments, it is close to UCI and satisfies my Bahn Mi cravings.Note: The prices on the menu on Yelp are not updated. I paid around $7 for each sandwich.",2/10/2018,_8NuAqkM6P-brqUnIRyVyg,"Irvine, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,3,Alice W.
6,"I came here while I was still in school at UCI. I come back here 4 years later to try their sandwiches, and they still taste just as great!It's a small cafe so inside seating is minimal but there is plenty of outdoor seating. And no matter what sandwich you pick, you can't go wrong!",2/25/2018,SeG553GZ4Sh2s_zptx-nRg,"Irvine, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,1,Charith S.
7,"Truly the most spectacular sandwich shop I have ever experienced in my life. I was lucky enough to go to a university right in from of Le Diplomate Café and I am lucky that I LOST weight during my four years at UC Irvine. Hands down, Le Diplomate has the best sandwiches at the best price. Go visit and just try their Garlic Chicken sandwich and you will leave satisfied and full!Le Diplomate Café is a small sandwich shop in the University Town Center (aka UTC). I think it has gone through the test of time because there have been quite a few restaurants that have opened and closed throughout the years. Le Diplomate is standing strong and I am incredibly happy. You can enjoy a 9"" sandwich for under $7. They also have happy hour specials which include a chip and drink for just $5-6. Perfect for college students and anybody who wants to dine on a dime! I've tasted a variety of their sandwiches and I have been happy with every single one of them. My absolute favorites are definitely the Chicken Garlic (ask for a side of extra garlic sauce - TRUST ME), the Chicken Cordon Bleu, and their Chicken Eggplant. What I love about Le Diplomate is that their sandwiches are simple yet flavorful and come out warm with a perfectly toasted French baguette. I think Le Diplomate Café is up there in my list of top restaurants. The food is delicious, the service is quick, and it is low cost. They also have drinks from teas, Italian sodas, smoothies, and coffee. It is a café afterall!",4/13/2018,ofF_b6MVWmVETd7DU6OJRg,"Kansas City, MO",5.0,5.0,yelp,2,Kent Jacob C.
8,"So disappointed that they are cheating on the orange juice! This is not acceptable. They claim the orange juice is fresh squeezed, and it is the most expensive drink on the menu. But today i saw the waitress just pouring the juice from the big bottle!!!????I wanted to point that out at the moment, but I remember waitress was having training last week. (Yes, I go there at least once a week)So I didn't want confront her and then I just left.  This made me so sad and disappointed! Cheating is a big deal! They lost a loyal customer and a lot of other customers who I have recommended to this place!",6/5/2018,pqpMTEkZkE2pEVbC2JAhkQ,"El Monte, CA",5.0,1.0,yelp,1,Paris L.
9,"One of my favorite sandwich places to this day! Always gotta get the garlic chicken with broccoli. Def a plus if you have a panini press at home to make it extra crispy if you're eating the second half as a leftover. 10/10, and it has never disappointed me once!",6/18/2018,k4DxQsViDbqMyxQDw5OZAg,"Irvine, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,1,Jessica P.

11,"""Triangular sandwiches taste better than square ones.""  --Peter KayThe hubs and I were up and about the area pretty early and needed a bite for breakfast.  We gave Le Diplomat a try over Peet's Coffee.  I'm a fan of La Vie en France bakery products and I noticed their signage indicating that they serve their products.  I decided on a Chicken Cordon Bleu Croissant and the hubs went with a Chicken Dijon sandwich.  My croissant was alright.  The croissant itself was lovely, and had a standard slice of ham, some chunk chicken, and a slice of Swiss cheese melted between them.  The hub's chicken dijon was good, but the sauce was rather salty and too rich. The butter was dripping out of the sandwich with every bite.  Don't get me wrong, we all love butter - but even this would make Paula Deen raise an eyebrow!",12/16/2017,pNURSToVRURKfPJ9JFQb_w,"Irvine, CA",5.0,3.0,yelp,7,Ingrid V.
12,"I've been here many times in the four years that I attended UCI. I went today with some co-workers for the first time since I graduated and it was just as delicious as I remember. I ordered the chicken garlic with bacon, which is my go to sandwich here. Honestly, I've probably been here over 20 times and I don't think I've ever ordered anything else. I know a lot of my friends love the chicken garlic with broccoli as well. Definitely grab a few of the hot sauces on the side to spice up your sandwich. They recently started serving various flavors of Italian sodas which are really good too if you're looking for something refreshing. I know they have a ton of other stuff on their menu, but I've never ventured out and tried any of it.There is minimal seating inside, but plenty of seating outside in the UTC area. The employees are always friendly and the service is on and off in terms of speed. Sometimes it's super quick and sometimes it's a bit of a wait. They also get pretty packed sometimes, so try going outside of peak hours. Overall, I'd definitely give it a try though if you go to school or work in the UCI area.",3/29/2018,XHPnbzPjhrmkOTx1LWJ9ZA,"Irvine, CA",5.0,4.0,yelp,1,Dana L.
13,"I have been coming here for over 10 years and have always been a fan of their sandwiches, especially the chicken garlic! However, in the last year or two they have gotten really stingy with the amount of garlic sauce they put on the sandwiches. The sandwiches come out really, really DRY! Recently I've been asking for extra sauce on the sandwich, which they've been doing. However today I asked for extra sauce and they charged me extra for it. When I got my sandwich, there was hardly any sauce at all! The driest sandwich I've ever eaten here. What happened to the quality of the sandwiches?!",2/14/2018,hdSsOo-JHaubcY2BE0TeJA,"Huntington Beach, CA",5.0,2.0,yelp,6,Carolyn M.
14,"I ALWAYS make a pit stop here whenever I'm in OC. I was first introduce to this little cafe one night when I was visiting my friend at UCI my freshman year of college and it CHANGED MY LIFE! My friend and I would sometimes drive from UCR to UCI just to eat here (and visit my friends too I guess, mostly for the sandwich). *CHICKEN CORDON-BLEU w/extra GARLIC SAUCE! I've tried their other sandwiches, and this one tops it all. PS: Don't forget to get their Sriracha Sauce! Sooo good with their sandwiches.",9/14/2017,O-gr-qEX3PCJGApn0KjVeA,"Rosemead, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,21,Shelley G.
15,"I've been coming to Le Dip since I was a student at UCI, and it's been delicious for over 10 years. In an area where the restaurants change frequently,  Le Dip is a mainstay that we can count on. It can get busy around lunch time, but your food comes relatively quickly even if they're busy.I have to admit, I always order the same thing, a 9 inch tuna melt with avocado, because it's so good I've never wanted to branch out, but a lot of my friends rave about their chicken sandwiches as well. Their baguettes are always super soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, and I always grab a tub of sriracha they have on the counter when I pick up my sandwich, and slather it on. You can get a combo for under ten bucks that includes the sandwich, a drink, and a bag of chips.If you're looking for a place to eat lunch at University Town Center (UTC), this is a great choice.",5/16/2018,0uiQxg-DKg_ia-kYtObCuA,"Costa Mesa, CA",5.0,4.0,yelp,1,Megan O.
16,So so disappointed. Hubby and I try to stop by every  time we're in the area since I love this place from my college days. I phoned ahead to pick up 2 chicken eggplant sandwiches. Unfortunately we found out once we got home we got the wrong sandwiches! We were given just the plain chicken garlic sandwich. On top of that the chicken was super dry and the bread was not fresh at all. I was so sad. As much as I love this place this last experience just fell flat all around. What a shame.,5/2/2018,It53fumHppJAEbFuj9WzOQ,"Lakewood, CA",5.0,2.0,yelp,1,Carissa U.
17,"Le Dip: one of UCI and the Irvine community's favorite places!Chicken broccoli mushroom with that famed garlic sauce is a winner. I've also had a couple of their vegetarian options... Any of their sandwich creations on that famed French baguette is DELICIOUS.People drool over their sandwiches. I save it for whenever I want to treat myself.Their drink options and smoothies are a nice addition as well. Chill day by UCI, this place never disappoints. In a plaza where big chain restaurants and starting to take over, it's no wonder our little Le Dip has survived. Their sandwiches are unbeatable.",9/9/2017,k_r5wznKM7ZZhEL4lsyjHg,"Irvine, CA",5.0,4.0,yelp,1,Rachel Ann C.
18,Finally had a chance to come here. I was told the sandwich to get was the chicken mushroom broccoli so that's what I ordered. The sandwich was pretty tasty. It was creamy and served hot. I chose to add the garlic sauce which was pretty tasty as well. Not sure how the other sandwiches hold up to the reviews but I'll definitely come back to try some more.,11/9/2017,aErsBeatF1aNxuCSziySAQ,"Irvine, CA",5.0,4.0,yelp,None,Elijah M.
