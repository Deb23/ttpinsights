0,"I've been waiting for my 3rd cut to post this, but Sue is such an amazing soul. I've never really enjoyed cuts from previous barbers, but I came to Kempt on a whim after seeing the Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. Yes - it's a pricey cut. I wish I could cut it regularly every 5 weeks, but the price makes me wait longer. Though, you get a complimentary drink, a t-shirt to change it, wash and shampoo (and head massage!), consultation, and an extraordinary cut.Sue knows hair so well to the point where she can look at my head shape and offer recommendations for the perfect cut. She cut my hair three times and every single time is slightly different (which I asked for!) and it comes out better and better every single time. I come home so thrilled about the cut and it just makes me feel good every single time. She's also the most personable barber ever. We always have great conversations and she gives wonderful advice. (for those that want a cut + life experiences)Not only that - she remembers me! She remembers small details after coming back every 5-7 weeks, and that surprises me so much! She remembered that I breakdance, where my girlfriend goes to school, and even our conversation from the last cut. I've worked at a coffee shop before and it takes me forever to remember people's name let alone small details about their life even if they come a few times a week, so props to Sue. I appreciate it!Great cut, great service, friendly, natural, and all-around the best experience I've ever had with a cut. I look forward to coming back for more cuts! I can't imagine going elsewhere now but to Sue for the perfect cut.",5/30/2018,VQhZMCY6b7jKyr-HDbrRaQ,"Irvine, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,Brian L.
1,"I have been to KEMPT twice and both experiences were pleasant. Coco cut my hair this time around and left me with a trendy haircut that feels polished. She was professional, and worked within her means to achieve the best look I described. Complimentary drinks are offered including water, coffee or beer. KEMPT offers an option to change into a fresh T-shirt they have in the changing room in order to avoid getting hairs on your own personal shirt you walked in with. This is great for business men who want to get a cut on their lunch break. The owners are always extremely friendly and the KEMPT vibes are genuine and welcoming.",5/2/2018,jaL8RSQ0SsxagLiNq0G1Pg,"Irvine, CA",5.0,4.0,yelp,None,Daniel E.
2,"I went on yelp, messaged 3 different salons and Coco was the 1st to reply with choices...the haircut was for my 17 yr old son...we have been to many Salons, but he was happy she gave him choices, appointment times and styles, with photos...Needless to say, we bought a 3 pack if haircuts and plan on continuing to go back beyond that...Thank you very much again CocoAdrian is happy",4/27/2018,O2hNoxxyvwPONcWoWkBp0w,"Santa Ana, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,jesse n.

14,"I went to 3 different men's hair salons before I found KEMPT on Yelp. I plan on coming back to KEMPT from now on. I'm picky about my hair so what I love about KEMPT is that every stylist is trained specifically to the standards of this store's owner. They spent time with me on my first cut to plan out what they were going to do and they kept notes about it for my future visits. As I guy who likes his hair on the longer side, it's important to me that the stylist knows what they are going to do before they start cutting and that they understand what I want. The shop is set up in a simple and modern way. I appreciate being offered a beverage, beer or non alcoholic. The website is easy to use to set up appointments. The owner makes it a point to say hello and spend a moment at the end with each client even though she may not cut their hair personally.",3/26/2018,6UVVBDoVUKLBfS6xAM1Z1w,"Irvine, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,Brian L.

The shop is very clean and cool, I was received with a very friendly smile from Melissa and asked if I wanted anything from water to beer while I waited and got my hair cut. Coco was not rushed at all took extra time to go over my needs and explained everything to me and even double checked and asked for input while doing certain portions.

22,"Feel great with a fresh cut. This isn't Supercuts churning out a cheap 10 min cut but quality from people that care about what they do.  Do yourself a favor and give Kempt a visit.  Online reservations on their site make it super simple. Melissa is amazing.  She really listened, gave a great consultation, taking time and care at the end of the day in an otherwise empty shop.  She knows what she is doing, she is passionate about it, and is a genuine human being.  What more could you possibly ask for?",1/19/2018,gtvcXkaqhICNpiPCcFCKIA,"Fullerton, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,Jon H.

25,Got my first cut with kempt today. The atmosphere is nice. I showed up a little early and was instantly welcomed by Melissa and offered a beer while I wait for her to finish up with her other client. Never been offered a beer at a salon or barber before. Great choice of beer as well. I had a choice of Stella or they also had a few different ballast point beers. I was offered to change into a clean shirt so I wouldn't get hair all over the shirt I came in with and get all itchy. Great idea! Melissa was very professional and thorough when it came to discussing the details and style of the cut I wanted. I can tell she really wants to get to know her clients and makes them feel welcomed. Great customer service. I'll definitely get my haircut here again.,2/3/2018,VcI26GByCDs0Ubltp0J6mg,"Long Beach, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,John B.
26,"Melissa has been cutting my hair for years, and she recently opened Kempt which is targeted for Men to make the experience great and enjoyable.Making appointments is easy. The space is awesome. Super clean and comfortable. Free Beer while you are getting your hair cut. Best of all.....Melissa and her other stylists are all focussed on the current styles for men's hair. If you are like me, getting your haircut is a pain in the ass, and usually not a priority. Melissa does a great job of making the experience fast, and painless while enjoying a nice IPA.

31,"By far, the best cut and friendliest service you'll find. Being a first time customer, I was nervous I wouldn't get what I wanted which is something you'd expect only from a stylist that knows you well. Today, I got what I wanted, maybe even better because she anticipated my needs very well. The service is worth it, hands down. But I'm not sure I'll make it a regular spot for $50 per cut/shampoo, but that's just me being a cheapskate. I think their price is right on target for what you get, maybe even a great value.

37,"After 4+ years at neighboring salon I was ready to switch it up and I'm very happy with Kempt.  I choose stylist Melissa and honestly couldn't of asked for more.  She's very sweet, you can tell she enjoys her craft, fun to talk to/easy going, communicates well and really takes the time to ask questions to be on the same page as to what you are looking for in a cut/style.  She's also in tune with what styles are current/what fits your head/face and good at giving her viewpoints as well but also listening to what you are looking for (engagement is nice).  You can just tell she really cares about making you look your best and never felt rushed at any point in time.  Beverage offerings are nice touch for comfort.  Salon is very clean, minimalistic, apple store meets hair salon look/feel.  All staff work well together in a happy free flowing culture.  They use quality targeted mens hair products (Hanz De Fuko has been my fav for years).  Tips for new clients to Kempt: Get the new customer package of 3 cuts for the price of 2.  You save some $ plus gives your stylist a chance to have a few cuts to really get to know you and your style over time.  Booking online is simple and makes it easy to process.  **Recently had an appointment where I got the times mixed up from 11:15 but thought it was 11:45 and Melissa gave me a call to check in at 11:30 and I was thankful for the heads up and she made it all work and not at any point made me feel bad about my mix up which put me at ease going into the cut (I tipped extra for my error in timing cause it was right thing to do).  Last tip: plan on getting there earlier because parking can be tough especially during peak lunch hours in the center.  Thank you to Melissa and the team!",3/7/2018,2DbVSUyIJWbwEj-ZoSw3sw,"Irvine, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,Travis B.
38,"This place has changed how I view haircuts. It is no longer a 'necessary evil' as a guy to take time out of your day to get a haircut. I actually now look forward to going there...for the beer, for the real conversations (not the cheesy ""never-going-to-see-you-again-Supercuts"" type of chat), for the awesome and attentive haircut, and mainly for the feeling I have when I leave - feeling good about myself. I love when someone really cares about their craft (I.e, my head, in this example) and Melissa is that person at Kempt for me. Parking can be tough around lunchtime since the center is so popular but the amenities are awesome and hard to beat. Kempt is one door down from the food court and the bar. I know too many dudes who have had their heads mauled by people who don't care. (Like, dudes who asked for a crew cut or fade and ended up with a 'step-from-the-early-90's' type of mauling) I highly recommend this joint (you will see in my review numbers that it takes a lot for me to actually review a place).

Aside from the clean, relaxing environment, the people here are so chill and accommodating! Most importantly, Sue, my go-to stylist, cuts my hair LIKE A BOSS! At previous places, my haircuts would look good for about 4 days and then on day 5 it decides to go all Sonic the Hedgehog with ends poking out in every direction that only cement can tame. Ever since Sue got a hold of my hair, I can go a whole month (sometimes longer) and still look fresh. My wife and daughters love my hairstyle now and that alone is enough to keep me coming back. 5 stars for this hidden gem and 500 stars for Sue!",2/15/2018,p1MZuDb4d74VbuLkDLHTWQ,"Irvine, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,Nick D.

44,"I can't say enough about this place. Finally a great place for the guys to get a haircut! I've tried the typical barbershops, sports clips, 18|8 and all the other places but Kempt blows all these out of the water! When I first walked in I noticed the badass bike against the wall and the two beautiful ladies working there. The shop was super clean inside and had a great look/vibe. I got my haircut by Coco and she did a great job!! Before getting started she asked me if I wanted to change my shirt so I didn't get annoying little hairs stuck in my shirt all day which was an amazing idea and worked perfectly. She sat me down and asked me what style I was going for and she knew exactly what to do. Before we started with the cut she shampooed my hair and I even got a head message with it, which was super relaxing! Then after that it got even better....I was offered a free beer to enjoy while getting my haircut. Coco was super friendly and Melissa the other stylist was also very friendly. In the end Coco absolutely nailed my haircut and gave me the best cut I have ever gotten! I made sure to rebook with her and buy the three pack...you pretty much get one haircut free when you buy it. I highly recommend anyone looking to get an amazing haircut experience to check this place out and book with Coco!!

I've tried great hair places for men from Hong Kong, to London, to NYC to SF & LA, and KEMPT is by far the best I've ever come across. From the moment you step in they are on top of service, friendly, welcoming and extremely professional. Everything from their appointment system and payment system, to their store design has been thought of and built around the customer. Cut was great too and truly a consultation to figure out the best option for YOU.",11/3/2017,UiVqk4NT0YlO4iMh4nR0UA,"Malibu, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,Alex G.

56,"Melissa did a fantastic job cutting my hair today and was also very nice to talk with while she cut it. I think this place has a great vibe and it is very modern, clean, and a great place for a man to get his hair cut. The quality makes all the difference and after years of going to different places to get my hair cut I think I finally found where I will be getting my hair cut for a long time. Not everyone know's how to cut a mans hair so it is so great I found KEMPT. I highly recommend going here for a hair cut next time you need one.",8/5/2017,uPUsgC7ivAB_RrcLrbWU0Q,"Irvine, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,Robert M.

66,"I found this salon in a newly renovated shopping center in Irvine that was formerly the home of Broadway Deli and is now the home of the TRADE food court.  I was greeted with a smile by Melissa (an owner I believe) and I immediately felt welcome.  Melissa began by asking me a series of questions to get an idea of what I was looking for with the haircut.  I could sense her genuine interest in focusing on getting the details right so that I would leave with a head of hair that made me happy.  She succeeded, fully.  I also enjoyed her conversation.  The space was very comfortable and nicely decorated and thankfully there was no blaring music. Kempt is a clean, calm and relaxing upscale men's salon.  Oh, and perhaps the most important thing to note that hopefully gives this review credence - Melissa did not even mention the words; review, yelp, referral, or social media.  Nor did I see a Yelp sticker on their front door.  I get the sense that Melissa knows that the combination of excellent haircutting, attention to the customer, and a really great environment are the essence of what a new business needs to develop the reputation that it deserves. It seems to me that the places that beg or incentivize you to leave reviews are the least deserving of the 5 stars anyway.  In summary: great spot - don't hesitate to give them your business.",6/9/2017,i-R1gHV6cIQ185nfDJAMTw,"CA, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,T T.
67,"IMO Melissa at Kempt is hands down the best men's stylist ever to cut my hair.  I've been to all the high end places all over LA/OC over the years, and no one has ever done as good a job with my hair as Melissa.  Plus, there's a pristine Norton motorcycle in the salon!",6/17/2017,NA_XixPMUMAMp2j5-QTYtw,"Orange County, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,Paul F.

69,"Exactly what I was looking for. Melissa is an expert at giving a men's haircut. If you're following your wife around to her stylist, or going to a cheap chain establishment, stop! I have always been very particular about my hair cut, and Melissa nailed it the first time. I know Melissa has been an expert at cutting mens hair for years, and now that she has opened Kempt, she's nailed it! She understands everything about a men's haircut. You also get a nice little head massage during your cut. Please schedule an appointment and see for yourself.",5/8/2017,LW4sWOhOre5Gisi8C4GioA,"Palm Desert, CA",5.0,5.0,yelp,None,Bryce B.
